# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project examining feature distributions and statistical properties of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using Python.

---

## Overview

This project explores a real-world medical dataset to better understand the characteristics and structure of features used in breast cancer diagnosis. The notebook walks through data loading, basic cleaning, and exploratory analysis to summarize key patterns in the dataset.

The focus is on gaining familiarity with the data and preparing it for further analysis or modeling.

## What the Project Does

* Loads and inspects a structured medical dataset
* Removes non-informative identifier columns
* Computes descriptive statistics for numeric features
* Examines feature distributions and relationships
* Organizes the data for potential downstream analysis

---

## Tools Used
